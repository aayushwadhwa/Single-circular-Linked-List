# Single-circular-Linked-List
Here we combine single linked list with circular linked list. We have some numbers as a part of single linked list and it that single linked list we have a circular linked list leaving some initial elements. This algorithm makes a linked list circular from which ever element you want and print the start of circular linked list.
